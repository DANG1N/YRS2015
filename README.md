# Survive School

[Survive School](https://yrs2015-simon816.c9.io) is a game created for [YRS Festival of Code 2015](http://hacks.youngrewiredstate.org/events/festival-of-code-2015/survive-school).

You play as either a student or a teacher. Each classroom is a minigame, the teacher in the room will ask you to do some challenge. Some of the minigames use open data, for example the current weather in real time may have an affect on the player.

It is written in JavaScript, PHP and some games are made in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu). It uses the [MelonJS](http://melonjs.org/) library.
